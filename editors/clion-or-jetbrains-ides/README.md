# Jakt plugin for CLion and other Jetbrains IDEs

This plugin provides syntax highlighting, autocomplete, type inlays and other things you would expect from an IDE.
It should be compatible with all the IntelliJ-based IDEs, but for simplicity we refer to CLion here.

The source code is contained in a separate repo here: https://github.com/mattco98/jakt-intellij-plugin

## Installation

This is a packaged plugin available on the [Jetbrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19462-jakt).
You can either click that link and install it from there, or install it from inside CLion itself:
`File > Settingsâ€¦ > Plugins`, choose the "Marketplace" tab, and search for "Jakt".
CLion will periodically check for plugin updates automatically.
